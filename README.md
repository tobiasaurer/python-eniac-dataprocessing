# Eniac Dataprocessing
This project is a part of the [DataScience Bootcamp](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/data-science-bootcamp/) at [WBS Coding School](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/).  Other datascience projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/tobiasaurer).

#### Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to answer business questions regarding the use of discounts for the company Eniac (online-shop).  
The quality of raw data had to be assessed and improved.  
Resulting data was used for analyses and corresponding visualisations.  
Business questions were answered and summarized in a presenation.

### Methods Used
* Data Cleaning
* Descriptive Statistics
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Matplotlib, seaborn

## Project Description
The dataset used is freely available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).  
  
Main goals of the project:  
* Assess and clean the data to make it usable
* Evaluate the effect of discounts on sales/revenue
* Make a recommendation on further discount practice
